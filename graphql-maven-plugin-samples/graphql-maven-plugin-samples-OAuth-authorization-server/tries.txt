This text file sums up the tries I did to make client_credentials work :


https://www.javainuse.com/spring/springboot-oauth2-client-grant

Seems nice and clear.
But the sample doesn't work: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in hibernate, despite there is no use of hibernate there.
It's probably possible to make this work, but it needs lots of updates in the pom configuration.
A try with a more recente version of Spring Boot leads to additional Spring security configuration that needs to be added, but it still doesn't work.

Baeldung
There is a rich Keycloak sample. But it doesn't seem to work with client_credentials.
The https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webclient-oauth2 seems interesting. But there isn't the OAuth provider details.

Needs an Okta account.
But I don't want Okta, as I want a build that can work in offline mode.
